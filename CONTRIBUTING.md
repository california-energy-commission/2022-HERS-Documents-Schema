# CONTRIBUTING

## Contributor Workflow

To contribute a patch, the workflow is as follows:

- Create topic branch
- Commit patches
- Push changes to your branch
- Create pull request

If a commit references an issue, please add the reference.
For example: `refs #321` or `fixes #12`. Using the `fixes` or
`closes` keywords will cause the applicable issue to be closed
when the pull request is merged.
